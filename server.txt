First create a folder in which you want to make the server -- book-storing-system
Next create a folder called -- server

Install the react packages -- use npx create-react-app client
This is used to create a folder called client with a basic react app
Then inside that install the necessary react packages: axios, react-router-dom, web-vitals

in the index.html paste the necessary url for bootstrap

Inside src create two folder: books and header
In the books folder you place the necessary js files like BookCreate.js, BookEdit.js, BookList.js, BookView.js
Place the necessary codes inside it
Place the header file in the header folder

Make the necessary changes to APP.js

Now in the server folder install the go components 
-- go mod init example/main

Now create a file called main.go and type in the necessary code 
Make the sure to connect the server in main.go with the server in the webpage
And then install the necessary packages from github etc which we have imported -- using go get <url>

and then run the server using go run main.go and client using npm start

Now check in MongoDB that your books are being stored correctly.
Create a database and collection with the name as in main.go //Config
Now you can see the data in MongoDB.

In Postman, run a GET request to http://localhost:8080/books to get all the books.
And you will see the books stored in the database.
